Absolutely! Here's a **detailed, task-focused plan** for **Day 1** of your 3-month Data Engineering journey — tailored for **4 hours of focused weekday learning**, with **sub-tasks**, **understanding questions**, **mini challenges**, and **tricky tasks** to push your thinking.

---

## 📅 **Day 1: Python Essentials for Data Engineering (Foundations)**

---

### ⏱ **Hour 1: Python Data Types, Variables, and Flow Control**

#### 🔹 **Sub-Tasks:**

* Understand and define variables: strings, integers, floats, booleans
* Learn `if`, `else`, `elif` logic
* Explore basic input/output functions
* Write and run basic Python code using a `.py` file or Jupyter Notebook

#### ❓ **Understanding Questions:**

* What’s the difference between `=` and `==` in Python?
* How does Python determine the data type of a variable?
* What happens if you compare a string to an integer?

#### ⚔️ **Challenge:**

Write a program that takes a user's name and age and prints:

> “Hello Alice, you’ll be 100 years old in the year 2090!”

✅ Example input:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
```

✅ Expected output:

```
Hello Alice, you’ll be 100 years old in the year 2090!
```

#### 🤯 **Tricky Task:**

Use a single line of code to:

```python
# Print whether a number is even or odd using a ternary operator
```

---

### ⏱ **Hour 2: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets)**

#### 🔹 **Sub-Tasks:**

* Learn operations on lists: append, pop, slice, index
* Understand the immutability of tuples
* Work with dictionaries: key-value access, `.get()`, `.keys()`, `.values()`
* Basic set operations: union, intersection, difference

#### ❓ **Understanding Questions:**

* When would you use a tuple over a list?
* What is the output of `my_dict.get("missing_key", "Not found")`?
* Can a dictionary key be a list? Why/why not?

#### ⚔️ **Challenge:**

Create a list of 5 students and their marks using a dictionary:

```python
students = {
    "Alice": 92,
    "Bob": 75,
    "Charlie": 88,
    "David": 64,
    "Eva": 99
}
```

* Print names of students who scored above 85.
* Print the average score.

#### 🤯 **Tricky Task:**

Use list comprehension to:

```python
# From a list of numbers, create a new list with only even squares of those numbers.
```

---

### ⏱ **Hour 3: Functions and File Handling (CSV, JSON)**

#### 🔹 **Sub-Tasks:**

* Define a function using `def`, use return vs print
* Understand arguments and default parameters
* Read from and write to a file using `open()`
* Use `json.load()` and `json.dump()`

#### ❓ **Understanding Questions:**

* What’s the difference between `return` and `print` in a function?
* What is the scope of a variable declared inside a function?
* How does `with open(...) as f:` help in file handling?

#### ⚔️ **Challenge:**

Write a function that takes a list of names and saves them to a file named `names.txt`.

Then write another function to read that file and print:

> “The file contains X names. First name is Y.”

#### 🤯 **Tricky Task:**

Given this JSON string:

```python
data = '{"students": [{"name": "Alice", "marks": 92}, {"name": "Bob", "marks": 75}]}'
```

* Parse the string and print all names of students who scored above 80.

---

### ⏱ **Hour 4: Pandas Basics & Mini Project: CSV Analyzer**

#### 🔹 **Sub-Tasks:**

* Install `pandas` and load a CSV file
* Use `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`, and `shape`
* Extract column names, filter rows, sort columns

#### ❓ **Understanding Questions:**

* What is the difference between `iloc` and `loc`?
* What happens when you try to access a column that doesn’t exist?
* How does `dropna()` behave by default?

#### ⚔️ **Challenge:**

Use Pandas to analyze a CSV file of your choice (e.g., weather, sales, student scores):

* Print number of rows and columns
* Show unique values from one categorical column
* Calculate average of a numeric column
* Sort top 5 rows based on a score

#### 🤯 **Tricky Task:**

Write a one-liner using Pandas to:

> “Count how many rows have a value greater than 90 in a column called `score`”

## 📝 Summary (End of Day Reflection)

Ask yourself:

* Which data structures did I find most useful or confusing?
* Could I build a program using only what I learned today?
* Did I understand how files and functions work together?
