# Data Engineering Roadmap (3 Months)

## Month 1: Foundations

### Week 1-2: Core Concepts & SQL
- **Learning:**
  - Understand data engineering vs data science
  - Learn relational database concepts
  - Master SQL (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, window functions)
  
- **Exercises:**
  - Create 3 normalized tables (users, orders, products) with relationships
  - Write complex queries with multiple joins and aggregations
  - Optimize slow queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE

*Challenge faced: Understanding query optimization early helps avoid performance issues at scale.*

### Week 3-4: Python for Data Engineering
- **Learning:**
  - Python basics with focus on data processing
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Basic ETL concepts
  
- **Exercises:**
  - Build a Python script that reads CSV, transforms data, and loads to SQLite
  - Create a data quality checker that validates dataset integrity
  - Implement a simple pipeline that processes hourly data batches

*Challenge faced: Memory management with large datasets before learning distributed systems.*

## Month 2: Intermediate Skills

### Week 5-6: Distributed Systems & Big Data
- **Learning:**
  - Hadoop ecosystem overview
  - Spark fundamentals (RDDs, DataFrames)
  - Distributed computing concepts
  
- **Exercises:**
  - Process 1GB dataset with PySpark (filter, aggregate, join)
  - Compare performance of Pandas vs Spark on the same task
  - Build a simple Spark streaming application

*Challenge faced: Debugging distributed systems requires different mindset than local code.*

### Week 7-8: Data Warehousing & Cloud
- **Learning:**
  - Star vs snowflake schemas
  - Cloud data platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Columnar storage formats (Parquet, ORC)
  
- **Exercises:**
  - Design a star schema for e-commerce data
  - Load data to cloud storage (S3/GCS) in Parquet format
  - Create partitioned tables in BigQuery/Redshift/Snowflake

*Challenge faced: Cost management in cloud environments as data scales.*

## Month 3: Advanced Topics & Production Systems

### Week 9-10: Workflow Orchestration
- **Learning:**
  - Airflow fundamentals
  - Pipeline monitoring
  - Data lineage concepts
  
- **Exercises:**
  - Create an Airflow DAG that runs daily ETL
  - Add error handling and alerts to your DAG
  - Implement data lineage tracking

*Challenge faced: Dependency management between complex workflows.*

### Week 11-12: Scalability & Optimization
- **Learning:**
  - Partitioning strategies
  - Data lake vs data mesh
  - Performance tuning
  
- **Exercises:**
  - Optimize a slow-running Spark job
  - Design a scalable ingestion system for IoT data
  - Implement incremental processing instead of full loads

*Challenge faced: Balancing data freshness with processing costs.*

## Scaling Challenges & Solutions

### Common Scaling Challenges:
1. **Data Volume Growth:**
   - Challenge: Queries slow down as data grows
   - Solution: Implement partitioning, clustering, and materialized views

2. **Pipeline Failures:**
   - Challenge: Complex dependencies lead to cascading failures
   - Solution: Implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation

3. **Cost Management:**
   - Challenge: Cloud costs spiral with increased usage
   - Solution: Right-size resources, implement usage quotas

4. **Data Quality:**
   - Challenge: Quality issues multiply with scale
   - Solution: Automated data quality checks at each stage

5. **Team Coordination:**
   - Challenge: Multiple engineers working on same pipelines
   - Solution: CI/CD for data pipelines, proper environment separation

```

### Key Principles:
1. **Modular Design:** Components should be independently deployable
2. **Environment Parity:** Keep dev/test/prod as similar as possible
3. **Infrastructure as Code:** Reproducible environments
4. **Testing Layers:** Unit, integration, and data quality tests
5. **Observability:** Built-in monitoring from day one

This roadmap balances fundamentals with practical skills while addressing real-world scaling challenges. Adjust pace based on your background and available time.
