Based on the 3-month data engineering roadmap provided, I’ll create a daily plan for **Monday, August 4, 2025**, assuming you’re starting at the beginning of the roadmap (Week 1: Python Programming Basics). You’ve specified 4 hours of daily dedication, excluding weekends. The plan is tailored for a beginner focusing on foundational Python skills for data engineering, with practical exercises to maximize learning within the 4-hour window.

### Today’s Plan: Monday, August 4, 2025 (Week 1, Day 1 – Python Programming Basics)

**Objective**: Understand Python basics (variables, data types, loops, functions) and start working with pandas for data manipulation.

**Total Time**: 4 hours

#### Hour 1 (9:14 AM – 10:14 AM): Python Fundamentals
- **Task**: Learn Python variables, data types (int, float, string, list, dictionary), and basic operations.
- **Activities**:
  - Watch a 20-minute video on Python basics (e.g., Codecademy’s free Python course or a YouTube tutorial like “Python for Beginners” by freeCodeCamp).
  - Spend 30 minutes practicing:
    - Create variables for different data types (e.g., `age = 25`, `prices = [10.99, 20.49]`, `customer = {"name": "John", "id": 123}`).
    - Perform operations: Calculate the sum of numbers in a list using a loop.
  - Write a simple script to print a dictionary’s values (e.g., customer details).
- **Resources**: Codecademy Python (free tier) or freeCodeCamp’s Python tutorial.
- **Output**: A Python script with basic variable operations saved to a file (e.g., `basics.py`).

#### Hour 2 (10:14 AM – 11:14 AM): Introduction to Functions and Error Handling
- **Task**: Learn how to write functions and handle errors in Python.
- **Activities**:
  - Read a 15-minute section on functions from “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python” (free online).
  - Spend 45 minutes practicing:
    - Write a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.
    - Add error handling (try/except) to handle non-numeric inputs.
    - Example: `def calculate_average(numbers): try: return sum(numbers) / len(numbers) except ZeroDivisionError: return 0`.
- **Resources**: “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python” (Chapter 3).
- **Output**: A Python script with a working function (`functions.py`) that calculates averages and handles errors.

#### Hour 3 (11:14 AM – 12:14 PM): Introduction to Pandas
- **Task**: Learn pandas basics for data manipulation (reading CSVs, basic operations).
- **Activities**:
  - Watch a 20-minute pandas introduction (e.g., DataCamp’s free pandas tutorial or YouTube’s “Pandas in 10 Minutes”).
  - Spend 40 minutes on an exercise:
    - Download a sample CSV (e.g., Kaggle’s “Retail Sales” dataset or create a simple CSV with columns: `order_id, product, price, quantity`).
    - Write a Python script using pandas to:
      - Read the CSV into a DataFrame.
      - Calculate total sales (`price * quantity`).
      - Save results to a new CSV (`sales_summary.csv`).
- **Resources**: Pandas documentation (free), Kaggle datasets (free).
- **Output**: A script (`sales_calc.py`) that processes a CSV and outputs a summary.

#### Hour 4 (12:14 PM – 1:14 PM): Practice and Review
- **Task**: Reinforce learning through practice and debugging.
- **Activities**:
  - Spend 30 minutes extending the pandas exercise:
    - Add a filter to exclude rows with missing values (`df.dropna()`).
    - Group data by product and calculate total sales per product.
  - Spend 20 minutes reviewing your code:
    - Debug any errors in your scripts.
    - Add comments to explain your logic.
  - Spend 10 minutes setting up a Git repository:
    - Initialize a local Git repo and commit your scripts (`git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Day 1 Python scripts"`).
- **Resources**: GitHub Desktop or Git command-line tutorial (free).
- **Output**: Updated `sales_calc.py` with filtering and grouping, committed to a local Git repo.

### Notes
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure Python 3.9+ and pandas are installed (`pip install pandas`). Use a code editor like VS Code.
- **Breaks**: Take a 5-minute break between hours to stay focused.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Syntax Errors**: Common for beginners. Use VS Code’s debugging tools or print statements to troubleshoot.
  - **CSV Issues**: Ensure your CSV is properly formatted. If stuck, use a simple dataset with 10–20 rows.
- **Next Steps**: Tomorrow, focus on loops and conditionals in Python, with more pandas exercises (e.g., merging datasets).
